Newcomers advice, by Shahriar Manzoor
The one of the greatest programmer of  the site of acm.uva.es, 
the proud of Bangladesh advises the  newcomers on his site. 
he is now the judge of the site. He is now the elite panel 
problem setter of the site acm.uva.es.  you can visit his 
site by the using the  URL http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds7-5/




Find the easier problems. Easier problems mean those problems
 that don’t need a particular algorithm as I assumed you as a
 programmer who don’t know many algorithms. Those problems are
 called ADHOC problems. You can find the list of those problems
 available in 24 OJ in S. Halim’s, acmbeginner’s, acmsolver’s
 websites. Try to solve these problems and in that way you can 
increase your programming capability. As far as I found, volume-4
 of Valladolid OJ has many easy ADHOC problems.
